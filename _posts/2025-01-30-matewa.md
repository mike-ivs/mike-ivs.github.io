Our first travel blog post! Today was the day we said mā te wā/see you soon to our friends in Aotearoa and begin our travels for 2025. 

We got off to a somewhat bumpy start: while we tidied the house for the final time we found out that our 2 week campervan hire for Tasmania was "cancelled due to unforeseen repairs"... yikes! Fortunately, after a few hours and chunk of stress we managed to find a replacement and then finished the house cleaning.

There was a silver lining when we got to the airport this afternoon - it turns out Chloë had booked our Australia flights while still an Emirates gold member meaning we got business lounge access one last time. 

We're now in Melbourne for our first leg of our Australia travels so make sure to check in every now and then to see what we've been up to. Mā te wā New Zealand, it's been a blast!
