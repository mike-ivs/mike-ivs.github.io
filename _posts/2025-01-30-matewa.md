Our first blog post!

Time to say mā te wā to our friends in Aotearoa and begin our travels for 2025. A somewhat bumpy start: while we tidied the house for the final time we found out that our 2 week campervan for Tasmania was "cancelled due to unforeseen repairs"... yikes! After a few hours and chunk of stress we managed to find a replacement, and then finished the cleaning.

We're at the airport now ready to begin our adventures, so make sure to check in every now and then to see what we've been up to. Mā te wā New Zealand, it's been a blast!
