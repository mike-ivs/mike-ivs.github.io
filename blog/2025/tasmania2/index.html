We then explored the main buildings - 5 storeys of cells, churches, and officers’ houses.

We decided to get to the summit via the organ pipes track. The view from the top was incredible despite being a bit rainy and cloudy. We were glad we carried out jumpers though because it was flipping cold and windy too! After 2 delicious days of hospitality we were back to camping food so a picnic lunch at the Springs car park was in line.

It definitely did not disappoint, we were told to go around 3pm to see the wombats, and that is exactly what we saw! 2 mothers and their Joey’s and a couple of other lone wombats too.

A cracking end to the day!</p> <p><a class="spotlight" href="/assets/img/blog/20250215/65.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/20250215/s/65.jpg"> </a></p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/phillip-penguins.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" controls=""></video> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="day-11-ulverstone-to-launceston">Day 11: Ulverstone to Launceston</h2> <p>Our final full day in Tasmania but we were determined to make the most of it . We left the campsite and made our way to Devonport for a bit of sightseeing. It wasn’t our cup of tea when we arrived, so we simply went for a stroll along the waterfront and carried on our journey.</p> <p>We called in at the House of Anvers chocolate place for a pitstop and a delicious dose of unhealthy goodness. The hot chocolate met my high Belgian choc standards and the cakes left us all very full!</p> <div class="spotlight-group"> <a class="spotlight" href="/assets/img/blog/20250215/66.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/20250215/s/66.jpg"> </a> <a class="spotlight" href="/assets/img/blog/20250215/67.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/20250215/s/67.jpg"> </a> <a class="spotlight" href="/assets/img/blog/20250215/68.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/20250215/s/68.jpg"> </a> </div> <p>In need of a walk to burn off our cocoa overdose we decided to visit the Warrawee reserve for a riverside walk to an epic swing bridge. This decision had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that it was a known platypus location…</p> <p>Chances for wildlife spotting looked high when Chloe saw a Tasmanian devil run across the road on the drive in. En-route to the bridge we saw pademelons and wallabies in the bushes, and even an echidna waddling by the river side (a blurry photo is my only proof!). The swing bridge itself was an impressive beast that even dad couldn’t sway (despite his best attempts!) and from it we could see the occasional patch of bubbles reaching the river surface.</p> <div class="spotlight-group"> <a class="spotlight" href="/assets/img/blog/20250215/69.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/20250215/s/69.jpg"> </a> <a class="spotlight" href="/assets/img/blog/20250215/70.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/20250215/s/70.jpg"> </a> <a class="spotlight" href="/assets/img/blog/20250215/71.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/20250215/s/71.jpg"> </a> </div> <p>We stayed on the bridge for around 20 minutes: long enough to still not see a platypus! After a walk back to the vans we set off on our journey and Chloe took us on a slight detour to finally see the elusive creature! This was the last main stop in our Tassie adventure but we popped off the main road to get Dad some honey we had promised him for most of the 2 weeks only to find it was a small but cute shack at someone’s house! We did however both buy some delicious raw honey.</p> <p>Once we arrived and set up for our final night in Hadson we decided to get a pizza takeaway. Turns out they were the friendliest pizza guys ever and the family pizzas were flipping delicious. They gave us some tips to spot platypus so we went to the local campground to try but once again the platypus eluded us!</p> <div class="spotlight-group"> <a class="spotlight" href="/assets/img/blog/20250215/72.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/20250215/s/72.jpg"> </a> <a class="spotlight" href="/assets/img/blog/20250215/73.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/20250215/s/73.jpg"> </a> <a class="spotlight" href="/assets/img/blog/20250215/74.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/20250215/s/74.jpg"> </a> </div> <h2 id="day-12-back-to-melbourne">Day 12: Back to Melbourne</h2> <p>The day had arrived for us to finish our Tasmania road trip and head back to the mainland. We packed up into our bags, swept up the van, and departed for the airport. A painless campervan dropoff and we were dropping our bags and boarding the flight to Melbourne with a background aroma of smoke from the St. Clair’s wildfires.</p> <div class="spotlight-group"> <a class="spotlight" href="/assets/img/blog/20250215/75.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/20250215/s/75.jpg"> </a> <a class="spotlight" href="/assets/img/blog/20250215/76.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/20250215/s/76.jpg"> </a> </div> <p>So long Tassie it’s been a blast!
