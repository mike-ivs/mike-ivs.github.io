ABSTRACT = {Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) provides a unique means of inferring geophysical conditions of the Earth’s surface without the need for costly, and often infeasible, in-situ climate monitoring systems. As part of NASA’s Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission, and in conjunction with Air New Zealand, we are taking the novel approach of mounting a GNSS-R receiver on a commercial aircraft, which shall allow for an unprecedented collection of climate data over and around the islands of New Zealand. Such data include inundation and coastal dynamics, and soil moisture content and variability. We report back to the community how the OpenSky Network data support our climate monitoring research. We discuss how we use the historical database state-vectors to simulate and visualise the predicted geographical coverage of the airborne GNSS-R receiver. We also discuss how the live API can help monitor our payload in-flight, our investigations into the OpenSky ADS-B coverage over New Zealand, and our plans to expand the coverage.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: BRASS (Belgian Repository of Fundamental Atomic Data and Stellar Spectra) is an international networking project for the development of a new public database providing accurate fundamental atomic data of vital importance for stellar spectroscopic research. We present an overview of research results obtained in the past four years. Methods: The BRASS database offers atomic line data we thoroughly tested by comparing theoretical and observed stellar spectra. We perform extensive quality assessments of selected atomic input data using advanced radiative transfer spectrum synthesis calculations, which we compare to high-resolution Mercator-HERMES and ESO-VLT-UVES spectra of F-, G-, and K-type benchmark stars observed with very high signal-to-noise ratios. We have retrieved about half a million atomic lines required for our detailed spectrum synthesis calculations from the literature and online databases such as VAMDC, NIST, VALD, CHIANTI, Spectr-W 3 , TIPbase, TOPbase, SpectroWeb. Results: The atomic datasets have been cross-matched based on line electronic configuration information and organized in a new online repository called BRASS. The validated atomic data, combined with the observed and theoretical spectra are also interactively offered in BRASS. The combination of these datasets is a novel approach for its development providing a universal reference for advanced stellar spectroscopic research. Conclusion: We present an overview of the BRASS Data Interface developments allowing online user interaction for the combined spectrum and atomic data display, line identification, atomic data accuracy assessments including line log(gf)-values, and line equivalent width measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {The Belgian repository of fundamental atomic data and stellar spectra (BRASS) aims to provide the largest systematic and homogeneous quality assessment to-date of input atomic data required for stellar spectral synthesis. In addition to quality-assessed atomic data, BRASS shall also provide of a range of extremely high-quality benchmark stellar spectra spanning late B-type stars to early K-type stars. In this paper, we summarise the project’s progress and available results to-date. We provide a brief comparison between our results and the BRASS project’s compiled and cross-matched atomic literature, with the goal of providing useful feedback to the atomic community on which methods may produce more reliable and accurate atomic data. We hope that the examples presented here stimulate further investigation by the atomic physics community.},

In preparation for our assessment we have cross-matched atomic line transitions from several different databases. Our investigation revealed significant updates in log(gf) values, sometimes as large as 2–4 dex, that fully justify the need for systematic quality assessments of the atomic data.

This star was a target in our programme to search for planets around a sample of 95 giant stars observed with Kepler. This detection was made possible using precise stellar radial velocity measurements of HD 175370 taken over five years and four months using the coudé echelle spectrograph of the 2-m Alfred Jensch Telescope and the fibre-fed echelle spectrograph High Efficiency and Resolution Mercator Echelle Spectrograph of the 1.2-m Mercator Telescope. Our radial velocity measurements reveal a periodic (349.5 ± 4.5 d) variation with a semi-amplitude K = 133 ± 25 m s− 1, superimposed on a long-term trend. A low-mass stellar companion with an orbital period of ∼88 yr in a highly eccentric orbit and a planet in a Keplerian orbit with an eccentricity e = 0.22 are the most plausible explanation of the radial velocity variations. However, we cannot exclude the existence of stellar envelope pulsations as a cause for the low-amplitude radial velocity variations and only future continued monitoring of this system may answer this uncertainty. From Kepler photometry, we find that HD 175370 is most likely a low-mass red giant branch or asymptotic giant branch star.},
